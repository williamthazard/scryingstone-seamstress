_So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it._ <br>
Isaiah 55:11

### Instructions

Save `scryingstone.lua` wherever you would normally save a seamstress script. Then run the seamstress and supercollider scripts at the same time. The seamstress script should be able to talk to SuperCollider by default, assuming SuperCollider is listening on port 57120 (as it is by default). If you've got sclang in your PATH, you can make a little shell script to open both with a single command. That's how I like to do it, anyway. I haven't included such a shell script here because you'd have to change the path to the supercollider script anyway. But feel free to reach out if you'd like help with that.
